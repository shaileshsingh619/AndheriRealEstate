                <b>Clear title to a property is one of the most important factors to be considered before

                <li><span>» </span>By studying the documents of title to ensure that the owner has proper
                    ownership to the property. The documents of title should be studied very carefully

                    is not built in accordance with sanctioned plans, the completion certificate will
                    not be granted. For buildings that are complete, occupation certificate/completion

                    (POA) on behalf of the owner. This POA should be closely scrutinised to ensure that
                    it is properly executed. </li>
                <li><span>» </span>The Bombay Stamp Act, 1958 was amended a few years ago whereby heavy
                    stamp duty is attracted on a POA in case the POA for sale of immovable property
                    is executed to a person not closely related to the executant. Thus in most cases
                    a POA is executed to a close relative as defined under the Act.</li>

                    leasehold and the residue tenure of lease is short and if there is no provision
                    for renewal on old rent, additional ground rent may be payable by the purchaser

                    the new model bye-laws, it is preferable to obtain such a noobjection as well as
                    a no dues letter from the society if the premises are in a society. </li>
                <li><span>» </span>In case the building is not conveyed to the society by the builder,
                    then noobjection of the builder should be obtained. It should be verified that the
                    seller has paid all his dues such as property tax, service-tax, VAT and other outgoings
                    to the society or the builder, as the case may be. </li>

                    seller under section 281 of the Income-tax Act, 1961. Further if the seller is a
                    nonresident of India, TDS may be deductible from the consideration paid unless certificate
                    for non-deduction or lower deduction is obtained from the concerned Income-tax officer.</li>

            <ul>
                <li><span>» </span>This aspect should be verified as well. For example, one should see
                    whether the property is residential or commercial as per the Development Control
                    Regulations. Other factors such as heritage rules, set-back for road widening may
                    apply to certain buildings, which should also be considered.</li>

            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li><span>» </span>The burden on the buyer is set to increase with the recent hike in
                    the Ready Reckoner (RR) rates. The Maharashtra government is on its way to increase
                    the ready reckoner rates for properties between 5% and 30%, depending on the size
                    and location in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra. </li>
                <li><span>» </span>The Ready Reckoner is used to calculate the market value of flats
                    for stamp duty and registration charges, which are major sources of revenue for
                    the government after sales tax and value-added tax.</li>
                <li><span>» </span>According to Adv. Vinod Sampat, this will also impact property transactions
                    making them costlier. He says, 'Redevelopment projects will be more affected and
                    this will also impact capital gains tax for developers. The developer will pass
                    the burden of the price hike to the buyer. </li>
                <li><span>» </span>The stamp duty and registration charges are also calculated on the
                    basis of these rates. As a result, the buyer will have to shell out more when he
                    makes a property purchase.' In the current situation, where the market activity
                    is sluggish, this move is bound to affect sentiment.</li>
